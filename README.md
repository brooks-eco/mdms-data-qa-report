# MDMS Data Quality Assurance (QA) Report Generator

## Summary

This python code provides a tool to automate the generation of data quality assurance (QA) reports from data exported from the Flow-MER Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS).

The reports consist of statistical summaries and graphical plots designed to be sent back to data suppliers. The primary goal is to help suppliers visually inspect and validate their data, ensuring it is a complete and accurate representation of their field collections before it is finalised and published.

## Data Quality Assurance Principles

### What is Quality Control (QC)?

Quality control is provided by activities that focus on identifying and managing data issues including **missing data**, **errors** and data that **do not conform to agreed data standards**.  The Flow-MER MDMS is a key part of how we exert quality control on our data.

Flow-MER Area-scale projects supply their monitoring data to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder's Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS). The MDMS is a central, secure database that provides several key services:

- **Secure Storage**: Securely stores monitoring data collected by previous and current Flow-MER projects.
- **Primary Validation**: Acts as a central gateway to receive data uploads and provides primary enforcement of data standards. It automatically detects, rejects, and reports non-conforming data, allowing suppliers to correct issues and resubmit.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregates data across all Area-scale projects and through time.

### What is Quality Assurance (QA) - The Role of this QA Report Tool

Quality assurance is provided by activities that ensure high-quality data are being generated by the Program.

This code base performs the crucial second step in the quality process. While the MDMS is excellent at enforcing structural data standards, these summary reports helps identify more subtle issues.

The quality reports are reviewed by the experts who collected the source data to ensure the data is accurate and as complete as possible. This review process has proven to be a critically important step for the early detection of data issues, particularly **mistakes in data entry**, **missing data** and the identification of **outliers** before the date is used as evidence in reporting. Data suppliers are responsible for reviewing these reports and confirming that the data are complete and accurate before data are declared ‘final’ and published.

How it works:

1. Monitoring data that are successfully uploaded to the MDMS are exported as Excel workbook files.
2. This code base ingests those exports and creates statistical data summaries and graphic plots.
3. The reports are provided back to the data supplier to confirm that the data received match the expected data supply.
4. After all issues are resolved the data is published to the [Flow-MER Data Portal](https://data.flow-mer.org.au) for use.

### Inputs

A single Microsoft Excel workbook (`.xlsx`) data export from the MDMS. This workbook may contain data for one or more monitoring themes (e.g., Fish, Waterbirds, Vegetation) across one or more groups.

### Output Data

A PDF and/or Markdown reports (or both) are generated for each Flow-MER are-scale monitoring group found within the input workbook. These reports are saved in the `Outputs` directory.

## Prerequisites and Notes

The script is configured via dataclasses found in the `configs` directory. Each monitoring theme data standard (e.g., `fish_config.py`) has its own configuration file that defines the expected workbook structure, table joins, summary statistics, and plots.

execution script: `python QA_report.py`

## Processing Environment

Python.  Requirements (key libraries)

        numpy
        pandas
        matplotlib
        reportlab
        openpyxl

```bash

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

#run script
python.exe QA_report.py

```


## Disclaimer

This code was built to do a specific job to help QA Flow-MER monitoring data from the Monitoring Data Management System (MDMS), not for production work using other data.
The code may be usable but will contain `grotty hacks` that there was not time to polish out.
